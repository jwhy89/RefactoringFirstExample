# RefactoringFirstExample
Testing "Refactoring: A First Example" from "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" book

This is my first exercise with refactoring that I am following along with the book.

Your function `statement` should be able to print the bill.

## Built With

- JavaScript
- Node.js

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the code challenge solution and run it on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required before you attempt to start the app (e.g. node, mongo).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installing

Steps to test the solution.

1. Download this project.
2. In terminal, navigate to your project folder and type `node statement.js`
3. You should see that Node.js has ran the `statement.js` file and will display the console log scripts.

### Completed Features

- [x] Set up json files and imported data into the needed variables for the function.

### Next Steps

- [ ] Start the refactoring process and document learning steps.
